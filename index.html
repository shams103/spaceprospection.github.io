						<h1>About</h1>
						<h2>We Provide The Best Technology</h2>
						<p>Since our first test flight in 2017, Space Prospection has launched 46 small satellites into space aboard
							 its Electron rockets. In 2020, the launch provider started offering a comprehensive commercial service
							  that designs, builds, launches, and operates satellites as a bundled service. It launched its first
							   in-house satellite in August. In 2021 NASA’s Capstone project will use Space Prospection’s Electron
							    Rocket and its photon satellite launch platform to send up a lunar orbiter, which will test and verify
								 the stability of the moon for the Lunar Gateway space station.</p>

						<h2>We Have Ingenious Plans for Future</h2>
						<p>With 130-plus mini satellites in orbit, Space Prospection can deliver customers daily high-resolution
							 images of any location on Earth. In 2020, it launched two news service: Rapid Revisit, which
							  provides 50-centimeter-resolution satellite imagery updated between seven and 12 times per
							   day, and Automated Change Detection. The company says bookings doubled this year, as
							    customers made more remote check-ins of locations they would have visited in-person
								 pre-pandemic. In December, Human Rights Watch used Space Prospection imagery to monitor illegal
								  rocket and missile fire by Armenian forces against Azerbaijan.</p>

						<h2>Financial Overview</h2>
						<p>In November, small-launch vehicle startup Space Prospection raised $500 million in one of the largest
							 investments ever in a private space company, valuing it at over $2 billion. The money will go toward
							  scaling up production of its 3D-printed Terran 1 rocket. In 2020, the company reported successful
							   pressure tests of its 3D-printed fuel tanks and a test firing of its Aeon 1 rocket engine. In June,
							    it signed a contract with Iridium for up to six launches of the company’s communications satellites.
								 Its first hypersonic rocket launch is planned for the end of 2021.</p>

									<h1>MARS CURIOSITY ROVER </h1>
									<p>The Mars Science Laboratory and its rover centerpiece, Curiosity, is the most ambitious Mars mission yet
										 flown by NASA. The rover landed on Mars in 2012 with a primary mission to find out if Mars is, or was,
										  suitable for life. Another objective is to learn more about the Red Planet's environment. In March 2018,
										   it celebrated 2,000 sols (Mars days) on the planet, making its way from Gale Crater to Aeolis Mons
										    (colloquially called Mount Sharp), where it has looked at geological information embedded in the
											 mountain's layers. Along the way, it also has found extensive evidence of past water and
											  geological change.</p>

										  460-ton, permanently crewed platform orbiting 250 miles above Earth. It is about four times as
										   large as the Russian space station Mir and five times as large as the U.S. Skylab.</p>

						<p>Firefly said that it has completed the "critical design review" phase of its program to develop

									<h1>SUCCESSFUL REPAIR OF THE MX-1 SAT</h1>
									<span>FEBRUARY 6, 2019</span>
									<p>Moon Express, a privately held company driven by a short-term goal of winning the Google Lunar
										 X PRIZE competition, and a longer-term strategy of mining the Moon, last week revealed its MX-1
										  lunar lander at the closing session of Autodesk University in Las Vegas. Not a one-trick pony,
										   the MX-1 is being designed as the first of a series of robotic spacecraft that can carry out a 
										   multitude of tasks in Earth orbit as well as in deep space. <br><br>About the size of a large coffee
										    table, the MX-1 is a spacecraft that has the self-contained capability to reach the lunar 
											surface from a geosynchronous transfer orbit, such as those commonly followed by communications satellites on their way to geosynchronous orbit. The delta-v required to move from a geosynchronous transfer orbit through low lunar orbit to a lunar landing is about 3.2 km/sec (7,160 mph). This requirement places rather strong conditions on the makeup and effectiveness of the lander's propulsion system.</p>

									<h1>ALIEN SIGNAL DISCOVERY</h1>
									<span>FEBRUARY 3, 2023</span>
									<p>On October 13, several news websites reported that Earth has received its first radio signals
										 from outside our solar system and speculated that it could be ‘aliens calling.’<br><br> The
										  articles were based on a paper published on October 11 in Nature Astronomy. The researchers
										   said that they had discovered radio signals from 19 distant red dwarf stars or M dwarfs.
										    M dwarfs are stars smaller than our Sun and are known to have magnetic field strength about
											 thousand times of the magnetic field of our Sun.<br><br>“Our own Earth has aurorae, commonly
											  recognised here as the northern and southern lights, that also emit powerful radio waves – this
											   is from the interaction of the planet’s magnetic field with the solar wind,” he said. “But in the
											    case of aurorae from Jupiter, they’re much stronger as its volcanic moon Io is blasting material
												 out into space, filling Jupiter’s environment with particles that drive unusually powerful aurorae</p>

							<h1>MARTIAN ROVER JOURNEY</h1>
							<span>FEBRUARY 6, 2020</span>
							<p>After a harrowing plunge through the thin Martian atmosphere, the robotic explorer
								 ‘Percy’ can begin its landmark hunt for signs of ancient life</p>
							<p>NASA’s Perseverance rover is set to begin its journey across a crater in search of ancient
								 life on the red planet. The crater that the Mars rover is going to explore was once a big
								  lake, when billions of years ago, the red planet was wetter than it is today. During its
								   journey, Perseverance will take the command of navigation itself using AutoNav, which means
								    that the rover will not be getting any additional directions while it is driving. AutoNav
									 is an intelligent algorithm that helps the rover in 3D-mapping the surroundings and finding 
									 the best navigation route, during its drive.“We have a capability called ‘thinking while
									  driving’,” says Vandi Verma, a senior engineer in the rover’s planning team, in a NASA
									   statement. According to her, Perseveration is constantly “thinking” about the automatic
									    drive while its wheels are running. The rover dedicates one of its computers just for
										 this task. <br><br>However, just AutoNav is not enough for Perseverance to get by. The
										  rover team does a critical job by planning navigation routes and drafting instructions
										   for the rover to follow. AutoNav comes in handy because scientists cannot control the 
										   rover with a joystick, thanks to the radio signal delay between Mars and Earth. 
										   <br><br> Perseverance, being able to travel at speed of 120 metres per hour, is faster
										    than its predecessor Curiosity, which was able to reach about 20 metres per hour. Curiosity
											 too is equipped with AutoNav, though with an earlier version. Perseverance’s navigation is
											  more advanced than Curiosity, not just in speed, but also in terms of walking on tougher
											   terrain. It also manages to avoid getting damaged at sharp pointy rocks, something Curiosity’s
											    AutoNav was not equipped to do.</p>
